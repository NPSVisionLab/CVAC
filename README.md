CVAC - the Computer Vision Algorithm Collection
====
This archive contains tools to access algorithms from the 
CV Algorithm Collection
through well-defined interfaces.  You can run algorithms as
"services" or as part of your "client" program space.  You
can easily obtain data from a "corpus" of labeled objects
for training or testing.  And you can exchange one algorithm
for another without modifying your code (much).

Documentation and Download
