{"name":"EasyCV","tagline":"Easy Computer Vision","body":"EasyCV - Easy Computer Vision\r\n====\r\n\r\nEasy Computer Vision is a library of tools to simplify the high-level\r\noperations on computer vision methods.  It provides access to\r\nalgorithms in the CV Algorithm Collection (CVAC) through well-defined\r\ninterfaces, it links annotation tools (LabelMe, VATIC) to algorithms,\r\nand it permits creation of new detectors and their performance\r\nevaluation.  You can connect to remotely running vision services, run\r\nalgorithms as services on your computer, or embed algorithms into your\r\nprogram space.  You can obtain and share a \"corpus\" of labeled objects\r\nfor training or testing.  And you can easily exchange one algorithm\r\nfor another without modifying your code (much).\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease see the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/wiki)\r\nfor complete instructions.  The\r\n[Downloads](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/wiki/Downloading-CVAC)\r\npage also lists binary installers for various operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe source code can be obtained by cloning the repository, either via\r\nthe \"Clone\" button above or via the command line git tool (`git clone\r\nhttps://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC.git localCvacDirectory`).  Again,\r\nmore detail is on the [Wiki\r\npages](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/wiki).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTake a look at the online documentation [overview and introduction]\r\n(https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/wiki/User-Documentation) on how\r\nto start EasyCV and how to run your first examples.\r\n\r\nSeveral tutorials and API documentation are available locally after\r\ninstallation:\r\n\r\n* [Mini tutorials](../../demo/demos.html) to get you started quickly\r\n ([online](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/tree/master/demo));\r\n* The Python [EasyCV](namespaceeasy.html) library API for high-level functionality; and\r\n* The [cvac:: namespace](namespacecvac.html) for data and service definitions.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nMore detailed instructions are on the [Wiki](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/wiki).  In summary:\r\n\r\n1. Fork it. (See the \"Fork\" button above.)\r\n2. Create a branch off the devel branch (`git checkout -b my_CVAC devel`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am \"Added parsing for MyAnnotations\"`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_CVAC`)\r\n5. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/NPSVisionLab/CVAC/pulls)\r\n6. Wait for the request to be merged\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
